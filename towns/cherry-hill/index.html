    <h2>Why Cherry Hill Is a High-Value Territory</h2>

    <div class="box">
        <ul>
            <li>Large residential population with high homeowner density</li>
            <li>Strong roof replacement cycle (15–30 year asphalt shingles)</li>
            <li>Seasonal wind and storm exposure</li>
            <li>Ideal neighborhood layouts for efficient outreach</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>How Our AI Roof Detection Works</h2>

    <div class="box">
        <ol>
            <li>High-resolution street-level imagery is captured.</li>
            <li>AI models analyze roofing and exterior condition signals.</li>
            <li>Properties are flagged by damage type and confidence score.</li>
            <li>Verified leads are delivered exclusively per vertical.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Curling or lifted shingles</li>
            <li>Visible hail impact indicators</li>

    <h2>ROI Example (Conservative Estimate)</h2>

    <div class="box">
        <p>Example scenario:</p>

            <li>$5,000 average profit per job</li>
            <li>2–3 closed projects</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Estimated annual profit impact: $10,000–$15,000+</strong></p>

    <h2>For Homeowners in Cherry Hill</h2>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="box">

        <p>Scanning frequency depends on deployment schedules and territory coverage.</p>

        <h3>Does NJLeads perform roofing work?</h3>
